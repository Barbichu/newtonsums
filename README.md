Newton series transformation

The following files are copied from Pierre Yves Strub development on elliptic curves, in order to support decomposition of polynomials in a decidable field:

polyall

The following files are copied and improved from the devlopment version of the mathematical components library:
polyorder
fraction
finmap

The following files are the core of the development on Newton series:
